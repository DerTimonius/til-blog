import AnimateCodeBlock from '~/components/AnimateCodeBlock.svelte';

A while back I wrote about how [terminal commands](/blog/til-7) helped me to gather come information of the most important files in a codebase. In the end, I even found an okayish tool for the job called _cloc_.
But for me, there were things missing: no git integration for example, or no complexity calculation.

I decided to build it myself, because why not? It seemed to be a great opportunity to learn a few things about how to recursively traverse a project, how to read a lot of files and how to get the information I want from them.

> You can check out the project, which is called `code-peek` on [my GitHub](https://github.com/DerTimonius/code-peek) and install it locally via `cargo install --git https://github.com/DerTimonius/code-peek.git` (you need to have Rust installed on your machine)

## Choosing a language

If you've read the title of this post, you'll of course know on what language I landed on, but I want to explain why I chose what I chose. I'm a full-stack dev and at work I'm using TypeScript almost exclusively. I do not have a college degree in computer science, my rudimentary knowledge there is completely self taught.

Therefore I don't have a lot of expertise (or even experience) with low level languages. But I felt drawn to them for some time now and after my first steps in Rust during [Advent of Code](/blog/til-15) I decided to build this tool in Rust. I contemplated about using and learning _Go_, but I figured that getting a solid, foundational knowledge in Rust, where I already know some of the syntax (unlike Go, which I never used before), might be the better option.

## Defining the tool

Now that I decided on what to use, I should define what I want to build (yes, I know, it would have been better to do this first, but as I already knew that this will be a CLI tool, the decision to go with Rust was an easy choice).

What was I missing in other similar tools?

1. The most important missing feature was the git integration. I want to not only display the number of files or length of a file, but also how often a file has been changed. With a lengthy `git log` command, this information should be pretty simple to get.
2. Last time I used the tool, I had to specifically ignore directories like the _node_modules_ that I don't really care about when figuring out which files are important. It would be nice to automatically ignore all files that can be found in the `.gitignore` file.
3. I want to be able to tell the program, how many files I want to get when looking for the largest files.
4. It would be nice to group lockfiles and maybe even config files.
5. A complexity calculation would also be pretty neat.

The last two points are optional for the moment and not part of my minimal requirements.

## Getting started with _clap_

What's important when writing a CLI tool as a beginner? Finding a package that helps you with displaying and parsing of the options that the user can use. In the JavaScript world, this would be something like `Commander` and `clack`, in the Rust world it's [`clap`](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/). There are a few ways to write a CLI using clap, I landed on not writing structs or `Arg::new()` and using the built-in macros like `command!` or `arg!` instead.

It's pretty straight forward to add arguments as flags, something I wanted to do because I have the flexibility to call specific arguments wherever I want. This way I can specify the number first and the directory afterwards and not be forced to specify the directory as the first argument at all times.

At the same time, I want to keep the initial command as simple as possible, where `code-peek` alone would be enough to run the program. The nice thing about _clap_ is that you can set every argument and subcommand (which I do not use as of writing this) as optional - and you could pass initial values to them, but I decided to add them later with pattern matching.

Here are all commands that you could use at the moment:

```rs title="cli.rs"
let matches = command!("code-peek")
    .name("Code Peek")
    .version(crate_version!())
    .about("A CLI tool to peek into codebases and gather insights")
    .arg(arg!([directory] -d --dir [DIRECTORY] "Directory to search, defaults to cwd").required(false))
    .arg(arg!([num] -n --num [NUMBER]  "Number of files to display, defaults to 10").required(false))
    .arg(
        arg!([exclude]
        -e --exclude [GLOB] ... "Globs to exclude other than the files in the .gitignore, expects a comma separated list. E.g. '*.txt,*.csv'"
        )
        .required(false),
    )
    .arg(arg!([all] -a --all "Display all available information").required(false))
    .arg(arg!([group] -g --group "Group the results by its extension").required(false))
    .arg(arg!([git] -t --git "Get git info - how many commits were made to each file").required(false))
    .arg(
        arg!([match]
            -m --match [GLOB] ... "Globs to check, expects a comma separated list. E.g. '*.txt,*.csv' (Only files that match the pattern will be processed)"
        )
        .required(false),
    )
    .get_matches();
```

Now, if I want to access anything from the flags, I can use `matches.get_one(<flag>)`:

```rs title="cli.rs"
let dir = match matches.get_one::<String>("directory") {
    Some(directory) => directory,
    None => default_dir,
};
```

Yes, I know I could have done something like `matches.get_one::<String>("directory").unwrap_or(default_dir)` but I like this better.

## Traversing the project

With all the information gathered from the arguments, in the next step I have to traverse the project in some way. I started with something like `std::fs::read_dir(dir).unwrap()`, which works, but I quickly realized that this would become pretty cumbersome as I have to manually ignore all files in the `.gitignore`. The biggest issue there is that the ignored paths/files are saved as glob patterns and I would have to use a package for this check.

And since I have to use a package anyway, I started looking for a package that a) traverses the project and b) automatically ignores the files in the gitignore. After some searching I found the aptly named [`ignore` crate](https://docs.rs/ignore/latest/ignore/) that does just that. As a bonus it also provides to option to override the _walker_ which I use for excluding glob patterns that are not in the gitignore.

## Getting the file information

Now that I'm traversing the project correctly, it's time to start getting some information from the files. My first idea was to simply display the number of lines per file:

```rs title="file.rs"
fn get_file_info(entry: &DirEntry, dir: &str) {
    let entry = entry.clone();
    let file_name = entry.file_name().to_str().unwrap().to_string();

    let lines = fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).unwrap().lines().count() as usize;
    println!("{file_name} is {lines} long");
}
```

In some projects, this would work just fine. But the moment I tried this in a project with pictures it failed. Why? Well, you can't use `fs::read_to_string()` on something that is not `utf-8`. Fixing this should be pretty simple by checking if the function errors or not:

<AnimateCodeBlock client:only lang="rs" previous={`fn get_file_info(entry: &DirEntry, dir: &str) {
    let entry = entry.clone();
    let file_name = entry.file_name().to_str().unwrap().to_string();

    let lines = fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).unwrap().lines().count() as usize;
    println!("{file_name} is {lines} long");
}`} next={`fn get_file_info(entry: &DirEntry, dir: &str) {
    let entry = entry.clone();
    let file_name = entry.file_name().to_str().unwrap().to_string();

    if fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).is_ok() {
        let lines = fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).unwrap().lines().count() as usize;
        println!("{file_name} is {lines} long");
    }
}`}/>

Nice, no errors now! Now I can create the `File struct`:

<AnimateCodeBlock client:only="svelte" lang="rs" next={`fn get_file_info(entry: &DirEntry, dir: &str) {
    let entry = entry.clone();
    let path = entry
        .path()
        .unwrap()
        .to_str()
        .unwrap()
        .to_string();
    let file_name = entry.file_name().to_str().unwrap().to_string();
    let extension = match entry.path().extension() {
        Some(ext) => ext.to_owned(),
        None => OsString::from("config"),
    };

    if fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).is_ok() {
        let lines = fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).unwrap().lines().count() as usize;
        return Some(File {
            name: file_name,
            path,
            extension,
            loc: lines,
            commits: None,
        });
    }
}`} previous={`fn get_file_info(entry: &DirEntry, dir: &str) {
    let entry = entry.clone();
    let file_name = entry.file_name().to_str().unwrap().to_string();

    if fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).is_ok() {
        let lines = fs::read_to_string(entry.path()).unwrap().lines().count() as usize;
        println!("{file_name} is {lines} long");
    }
}`}/>

## It's time for git

But this information is not the only I want to get from the files. I also want to know how often they have been changed in the past. Why? A file with 1,000 lines of code that has been changed 5 times might not be as important as a file with 150 lines of code that has been changed 90 times.

How do we get this information? I actually referenced my own [blog post](/blog/til-7), where I described how to leverage infos found in `git log`. I decided to use a shorter command this time:

```sh
git log --pretty=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c
```

But how do I actually run this? Knowing that `execa` exists for JavaScript, I just had to figure out how to do this in Rust. The great thing is that there is no need to install another package, the standard library has everything I need with `std::process::Command`. Now I can read the _stdout_, but how do I parse it? Enter `nom`, a string parsing tool I used in Advent of Code a lot.

How does the output of the command look like? It starts with a singular number that represents the total number of commits, followed by the individual commits per file. I wrote a parses to take care of this:

```rs title="git.rs"
fn parse_git_commits(input: &str) -> IResult<&str, (usize, HashMap<&str, u32>)> {
    let (input, commits) = take_till(|x| x == '\n')(input)?;

    let commits = commits
        .trim()
        .parse::<usize>()
        .expect("should be a valid integer");

    let (input, file_info) = preceded(
        line_ending,
        separated_list1(
            line_ending,
            separated_pair(
                preceded(multispace0, complete::u32),
                multispace1,
                not_line_ending,
            ),
        ),
    )(input)?;

    let mut file_map: HashMap<&str, u32> = HashMap::new();

    for (num, name) in file_info.iter() {
        file_map.insert(name.trim(), *num);
    }

    Ok((input, (commits, file_map)))
}
```

I'm returning a hashmap of the files where the file is the key and the commits are the values. But why? Well, I did not add the number of commits to the files just yet. I already have a vector of files, so whatever I'm doing to get the number of commits to the file is at least _O(n)_. Using a hashmap here should speed this process up a bit as looking up the value in a hashmap is an _O(1)_ operation.

```rs title="git.rs"
for file in files.iter_mut() {
    let commits = match file_map.get(file.path.as_str()) {
        Some(x) => *x as usize,
        _ => 1,
    };
    file.add_commits(commits)
}
```

I also thought, why not displaying the contributors that have added the most commits to a project? That was pretty simple, I just had to use a different command:

```sh
git log --format='%aN' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

This time I had to sort the output as it actually matters.

## Displaying the information

The minimal requirements are almost fulfilled. In the last step I had to find a way to display the information. I knew I wanted to display them in a table of some sorts with some colors to distinguish specific parts of the result from another. Tables are always hard to do, so I looked for packages. I tried some of them and landed on [`term-table`](https://crates.io/crates/term-table). To be honest, I'm not 100% happy with it but for the moment it's fine. I probably will change it at some point, but it's not my priority now.

To color the output, I found [`colored`](https://crates.io/crates/colored) which is very simple and exactly what I needed.

What information gets displayed is up to the user. Adding the `-g` flag groups the information by the language used, `-t` adds the git information. With `-a` every piece of information gathered gets displayed.

## Missing features

Building this tool was a fun challenge, getting to know more about standard libraries, how to read files, how to trigger commands and reading the output and much more.

Now that I have a simple tool that does what it's supposed to do, I can start improving it and add more features. The calculation of complexity for example is something that I want to add. At this point in time, it would be a pretty simple calculation as I only have the information of lines of code and number of commits, but in the future there might be more things I could add to the calculation.

I also want to group the lockfiles and config files together in some way, I haven't decided yet. But I already know that improving the project will also improve my knowledge of Rust. And what more could I want from a pet project like this?
