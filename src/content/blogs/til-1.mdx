Slap bracelets were great when I was a kid. The first one I got was pretty much just reflective tape, but I loved it.
The feeling of it curling up at your wrist never seized to amaze me.

I always wondered how they work, but as time passed, the enthusiasm of a child left me and I forgot about slap bracelets. This is until I stumbled upon a video by the great Hank Green about them.

One of his kids went to a birthday party and got a slap bracelet (minecraft themed!), but it, of course, fell apart pretty soon.

## The discovery

What Hank discovered amazed him and filled me with joy: It's just a rounded piece of measuring tape. Not only the metal that's used, but with all the markings, the yellow color - everything.

It makes sense, measuring tape is cheap and (as anyone who has ever used it knows) it has the tendency to curl up.
